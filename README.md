# DeepPhenoSE
The code's logic is similar to the one's of deeppheno created by Maxat in Computational Bioscience Research Center(KAUST). The difference is that this code works by using bytorch which is new and believed to be easier to use.
The code that runs to generate the data is called phenotorch2.py and evaluate.py is used to evaluate the data generated by the first one.

# About the Data used
You can find the data by contacting Maxat from KAUST on maxat.kulmanov@kaust.edu.sa
